    <h1>Saanvi Ranadive</h1>
    <p>I am a second year Data Science student at UC San Diego. I am working as a 
        software engineer at the Mesirov Lab at UCSD Medical School. I enjoy 
        solving problems through machine learning, and have most recently developed 
    a pipeline that uses Random Forest Classification to detect Alzheimer's Disease. </p>
