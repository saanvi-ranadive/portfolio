    <p>Hi, I am a second year Data Science student at UC San Diego. I work as a 
        software developer at UCSD's Mesirov Lab. I enjoy solving problems through 
        machine learning, and have most recently developed a pipeline that uses 
        Random Forest Classification to detect Alzheimer's Disease. </p>
